#### Information

The goal of this project is to develop machine learning algorithm, together with scikit-learn Python module, to predict the person of interest (POI) of a fraud from the email and financial (E+F) dataset. POIs were ‘individuals who were indicted, reached a settlement, or plea deal with the government, or testified in exchange for prosecution immunity.’  The E+F dataset from the Enron Corpus was used as features for the POI prediction.
